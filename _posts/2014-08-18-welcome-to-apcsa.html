<p>Welcome to AP Computer Science A! </p>
<p>Here are the rules for Classcraft for you to look over: <a href="../resources/ClasscraftRules.pdf">ClasscraftRules</a></p>
<p>Please complete the following two tasks today: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Fill out the <strong>Tech Survey</strong>. I will use this information to setup your Piazza and Classcraft accounts so do this first.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/galileoweb.org/forms/d/1GfvVp93dEogI4H78bTl9BiwfWla_bLFO8XX6OcAhCQ8/viewform">Tech Survey link</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Write your first Hello World program in Java.
    <ol>
      <li>Open Start Menu &gt; All Programs &gt; Programming tools &gt; Eclipse</li>
      <li>Eclipse will ask you for a workspace. Choose a folder that you have access to (you may want to create one).</li>
      <li>Close the Welcome tab if it is displayed.</li>
      <li>Create a new Java Project by selecting File &gt; New &gt; Java Project</li>
      <li>Name your project &quot;Hello&quot; and click Finish.</li>
      <li>Create a new Java file by selecting File &gt; New &gt; Class</li>
      <li>Name your file &quot;Hello&quot;. Make sure that the &quot;public static void main(String[] args) checkbox is checked. Click Finish.</li>
      <li>Within the curly braces of the main method, add the following line:<br>
        <code>System.out.println(&quot;Hello world&quot;);</code>
      </li>
      <li>Compile and run your program by selecting Run &gt; Run As &gt; Java Application</li>
      <li>Check that &quot;Hello world&quot; appears in the Eclipse console.</li>
    </ol>
  </li>
  </ul>
<p>Again, welcome to APCSA! Let's have a fun and exciting year!
