<p>
  <strong>Part 1:</strong>
</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re going to take another look at functions and do some math today. Complete this <strong><a href="MultivariableFunctions.doc" target="_blank">worksheet</a></strong> before moving on to Part 2.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2:</strong></p>
<p>We will now take our multi-variable functions and turn them into multi-parameter methods in Java. You will create two files in your Java project:<code> GeometryLab.java</code> and <code>GeometryLabTest.java</code>. The first Java file will have your method definitions from the worksheet. The second file will have a <code>main</code> method with the method invocations/calls from the worksheet and use <code>System.out.println</code> to print out your answers. Check your answers with the worksheet answers from Part 1.</p>
