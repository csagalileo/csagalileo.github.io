Create a page named <strong>Reflection 19</strong> under the Reflections category of your portfolio and answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
<li>
Suppose you have a deck of cards and you want to find the Ace of Spades. If the deck is shuffled, which is the best search algorithm to use and why?</li>
<li>What other examples of searching have you seen in the real world? Do they use sequential, binary, or some other search?</li>
</ul>
