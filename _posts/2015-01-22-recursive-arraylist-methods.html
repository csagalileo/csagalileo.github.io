  title: Recursive ArrayList Methods

<p>Some of the things you need to know how to do with ArrayList are:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Counting elements</li>
  <li>Printing elements</li>
  <li>Summing elements</li>
  <li>Replacing elements</li>
  <li>Finding the maximum</li>
  <li>Finding the minimun</li>
  <li>Adding elements</li>
  <li>Removing elements</li>
</ul>
<p>You should already be familiar with how to do all of these iteratively (using loops). In this assignment, you will write methods to do them recursively.</p>
<p>Fork the <a href="https://github.com/galileo2014-15/RecursiveArrayListMethods" target="_blank">RecursiveArrayListMethods</a> repository. Here is the new way we'll be developing code:</p>
<ol>
<li>Go to <a href="https://c9.io/" target="_blank">c9.io</a>.
<li>Click on the GitHub icon in the top right to sign in using your GitHub account.
<li>Authorize Cloud 9 to link your GitHub account.
<li>You should now see your Cloud 9 Dashboard. Look for and select the RecursiveArrayListMethods repository on the left under Private Projects on GitHub.
<li>Click on Clone to Edit.
<li>Once Cloud 9 has finished cloning your repository, click on Start Editing.
<li>You will now see your Cloud 9 IDE with your repository files. You can click on them to open them. Remember that you should edit the .java files only, not the .class files.
<li>Complete the lab assignment.
<li>Use git in the terminal on the bottom of your workspace to commit and push your files to GitHub.
<br>Check your changed files using the git status command
<br><pre><code>git status</code></pre>
<br>Stage your uncommited files (this is for adding all uncommited files):
<br><pre><code>git add --all</code><pre>
<br>Commit your staged files:
<br><pre><code>git commit -m "This is your commit message."</code></pre>
<br>Push(sync) your changes to GitHub.
<br><pre><code>git push</code></pre>
<li>Create your pull request on GitHub as usual to submit the assignment.
</ol>
