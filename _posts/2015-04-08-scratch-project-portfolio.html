<p>To end our Scratch unit, you will create a studio with your best projects. Create a <strong>Google Doc</strong> and answer the 5 questions: <a href="https://sfusd.edmodo.com/file/view-crocodoc-new-window?uuid=bc47dc74-3e5a-46f0-8a5e-ed978a6f6078&file_id=150655391" target="_blank">Scratch Project Portfolio</a></p>

<p>You should be writing at least a paragraph for each question. Be sure to include a link to your studio at the end of your Google Doc. When you are done, make sure to share the Google Doc with <strong>tand@galileoweb.org</strong>.</p>
