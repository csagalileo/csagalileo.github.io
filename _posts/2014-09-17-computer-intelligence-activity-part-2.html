<p>Make sure you have answered all the <strong>bolded</strong> questions from <strong>Part 1</strong> before moving on to<strong>Part 2</strong>. Again, for Part 2, write your responses to the <strong>bolded</strong> questions in your journal.</p>
<p><strong>Part 2</strong></p>
<ol>
  <li>Go to <strong><a href="http://20q.net/" target="_blank">20q.net</a></strong>. Choose your language (Think in American is recommended) and play the classic 20Q game. You are supposed to think of something in that category and answer the computer&rsquo;s questions by clicking them. The computer will try to guess what you chose in 20 questions or less. Play the game several times addressing each of the following:
    <ul>
      <li>Pick an item and see how many questions are required.</li>
      <li>Choose the same item and see if you can make it require more questions</li>
      <li>Repeat this with another item.</li>
      <li><strong>How intelligent is this? Would this pass the Turing Test?</strong></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Choose one of the themed games from the bottom of the main page. <strong>Does the AI make better guesses when playing a themed game?</strong></li>
  <li>The Turing test is a person checking to see if it is talking to a computer. <strong>Can you think of any occasions that a computer might want to know if it is talking to another computer or a real life person?</strong></li>
</ol>
