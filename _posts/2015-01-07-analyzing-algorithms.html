<strong><em>Searching and Sorting Experiments.</em></strong> In this lesson we are going to use an App Inventor app to experiment with and analyze the algorithms we have been studying. You will be running two different apps, one to test the search algorithms and one to test the sorting algorithms.
        <p>This activity will resemble that of a scientific investigation. You'll run the apps repeatedly on different lists of data, record the running times of the algorithms, tabulate and graph your data, and then analyze the results. Can you figure out from the results, which algorithm is which?</p>
        <p>Another way to look at this activity is as <em>quality assurance (QA)</em>. Many careers in the computing field start with assignments in QA. This is where you help software developers test and debug their apps.</p>
        <p><strong>Objectives:</strong> In this lesson you will learn to :</p>
<ul>
          <li>conduct an empirical (experimental) investigation of basic search and sort algorithms;</li>
          <li>think analytically about basic search and sort algorithms;</li>
          <li>deepen your understanding of basic search and sort algorithms.</li>
</ul>
        
<strong>Introduction</strong>
<p>In this lesson we want to continue our study of algorithms, including the following questions.</p>
<ul>
  <li>What is algorithm analysis?</li>
  <li>What are the main categories for analyzing the running time of algorithms?</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Empirical Search Analysis.</em></strong> In this activity you are going to use an App Inventor app to experiment with and analyze the binary and sequential search algorithms.
</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a portfolio page named <em>Search Experiment</em>.</li>
          <li>Use the Barcode Scanner app -- you can download it from the Play Store if you don't have it — to download the <a href="http://appinventor.cs.trincoll.edu/csp/gcb/SearchExperiment.apk" target="_blank">Search Experiment app (APK)</a> from the QR code: <br>
            <img src="SearchAppQR.png" alt="" align="right">If you are using the emulator, you can download the <a href="https://ram8647.appspot.com/mobileCSP/assets/img/SearchExperiment.aia" target="_blank">aia file</a> and import it into App Inventor.</li>
          <li>You will be performing a <strong>worst case</strong> analysis of the algorithms. Whenever you press the search button, the app will search for a number that is<em>not</em> in the list.</li>
          <li>Test each search algorithm on lists of size 1000, 2000, ..., 10,000 numbers. <strong>NOTE:</strong>Because these algorithms involve loops, you may see an ANR (App Not Responding) popup informing you that the app is not responding and giving you the option to "wait" or stop the app. Choose "wait".</li>
          <li>Create a table on your portfolio and write the search time in milliseconds (ms) for each test case. You should have a total of 20 test cases, 10 for each algorithm.</li>
          <li>Use graph paper<a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/0B5ZVxaK8f0u9NjNuaTZ5S0Z4OUE/edit?usp=sharing"></a> (or a spreadsheet) to record and graph your results. Take a picture of your graph and upload it to your portfolio.</li>
          <li>Analyze your results to determine which algorithm is which. Which is the <em>binary</em> and which is the <em>sequential</em> search. Provide a clear description, referring to your graph and your tabulated data, to explain how you arrived at your conclusion.</li>

<ol>
  <li>For a list of 500 numbers, at most how many guesses would it take using <strong>binary search</strong> to guess the secret number if after each guess you were told whether your guess was too high or too low or just right? Type your answer into the text box. <br>
