<p> In this project, you will create a 30 second countdown timer. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a variable called timer.</li>
  <li> When the flag is clicked, initialize the timer to 30.</li>
  <li> Continually, wait 1 second and check if the timer = 0<br />
    a. output the current time either with a sprite or just show the variable<br />
    b. If the timer = 0 make either the background or a huge sprite say “Time’s Up”</li>
  <li> When the flag is clicked, everything should start over.</li>
  <li>Make sure the timer stops at 0 and does not continue into negatives.</li>
  <li> Be creative as to what you want your program to look like. Some suggestions are: use number sprites instead of the variable, add sounds or animations, or take user input for setting the number of seconds.</li>
</ol>
