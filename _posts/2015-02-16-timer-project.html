<p> In this project, you will create a 30 second countdown timer. The timer should decrease by 1 every second until it gets to 0 and should not go below 0 (i.e. it should never be negative). It should also change the background when it reaches 0 to signal that time is up. You may also choose to add enhancements to it, such as using number sprites instead of the variable, adding sounds or animations, or taking user input for setting the number of seconds. </p>
