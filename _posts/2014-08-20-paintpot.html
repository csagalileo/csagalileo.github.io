<p>I have installed the aiStarter application so that you can now test your HelloPurr app from yesterday in the emulator. To start the aiStarter application, open it from Start Menu &gt; All Programs &gt; Programming tools &gt; aiStarter
<p>The next app you will make today will make improvements to your HelloPurr app. You may start a new project or make a copy of your existing HelloPurr project. Here are the two parts of the PaintPot app that you will complete today:
<ul>
  <li><a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/paintpot-part1.html" target="_blank">PaintPot (Part 1)</a></li>
  <li><a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/paintpot-part2.html" target="_blank">PaintPot (Part 2)</a></li>
</ul>
<p>Make sure to test your app. When you are finished, write a reflection (name it <strong>Reflection 2</strong>) in your Google Sites portfolio that explains in your own words what is happening in the Canvas1.Touched event compared to the Canvas1.Drag events. </p>
