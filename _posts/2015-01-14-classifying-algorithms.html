<strong><em>Classifying Algorithms</em></strong> In computer science algorithms, and the problems they solve, are classified into several categories based on their efficiency -- that is, based on how their run time or use of memory grows as the number of inputs grows.
<p>You've already done this classification for searching and sorting algorithms. In this lesson we are going to take a more general look, both theoretically and experimentally, at this classification process.</p>
<p>For our experimental work in this lesson, we have an app that has two mystery algorithms that you will run to determine experimentally which efficiency category they belong to.</p>
<p>Another focus of this lesson is to introduce you to some of the limits of algorithms. As we are going to see, there are so-called <em><strong>intractable problems</strong></em> -- i.e., problems for which we don't have efficient enough algorithms to solve them for large values of N.</p>
<p>There are also so-called <em><strong>undecidable problems</strong></em>. These are problems that are impossible to solve -- i.e, there cannot be an algorithm to solve these types of problems.</p>
<p><strong>Objectives:</strong> In this lesson you will learn to :</p>
<ul>
  <li>think theoretically and abstractly about the efficiency of algorithms;</li>
  <li>conduct an empirical (experimental) investigation of an algorithm;</li>
  <li>learn about certain important limits of algorithms.</li>
</ul>

<p><strong><em>Empirical Classification Activity</em></strong> In this activity you are going to use an App Inventor app to experiment with and analyze the an algorithm.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Create a portfolio page named <em>Classification Experiment</em>.</li>
  <li>Use the Barcode Scanner app -- you can download it from the Play Store if you don't have it — to download the <a href="http://appinventor.cs.trincoll.edu/csp/gcb/ClassifyExperiment.apk" target="_blank">ClassifyExperiment app (APK)</a> from the QR code: <br>
    <img align="right" src="ClassifyExperimentQR.png">If you are using the emulator, you can download the <a href="https://ram8647.appspot.com/mobileCSP/assets/img/ClassifyExperiment.aia" target="_blank">aia file</a> and import it into App Inventor.</li>
  <li>You will be performing a <strong>worst case</strong> analysis of the algorithms for values of N = 100, 200, ..., 1000. When you press the <em>Algorithm 1</em> or<em>Algorithm 2</em> buttons the app will run a mystery algorithm and report the results.</li>
  <li>Test the algorithms for values of Size = 100, 200, ..., 1,000. <strong>NOTE: </strong>Because these algorithms involve loops, you may see an ANR (App Not Responding) popup informing you that the app is not responding and giving you the option to "wait" or stop the app. Choose "wait".</li>
  <li>Create a table on your portfolio and write the run time in milliseconds (ms) for each test case. You should have a total of at least 20 test cases.</li>
  <li>If you want to graph your results by hand, you can use graph paper to plot your results. Let the X-axis represent the size, which should range from 100, 200, up to 1000. And let the Y-axis represent the time in millseconds that the algorithms took. Number the Y-axis from 2000, 4000, ..., 20,000. Then plot the results you obtained for both Algorithm1 and Algorithm2. For example, if Algorithm1 took 510 ms when the size was 100, you would plot the point (100,510). After you've plotted all the points for a given algorithm, draw a line (or curve) through the points. When you are done, take a picture of your graph and upload it to your portfolio.</li>
  <li>If you prefer, you can use a free online tool, such as <a href="http://www.shodor.org/interactivate/activities/SimplePlot/" target="_blank">Shodor's Interactivate site</a> to graph your results. Take a screenshot of your graphs and upload them to your portfolio.</li>
  <li>Analyze your results to determine which <em>efficiency category</em> the algorithms belong to -- <em>logarithmic</em>, <em>linear</em>, <em>n log n</em> <em>quadratic</em>? Provide a clear description, referring to your graph and your tabulated data, to explain how you arrived at your conclusion.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>Reflection 24</strong></p>
<p>Create a page named <em><strong>Reflection 24</strong></em> under the <em>Reflections</em> category of your portfolio. Classify the following algorithms. That is, as N gets larger classify the run time efficiency of this algorithm in term of one of the efficiency categories -- logarithmic, linear, n log n, or quadratic. And justify your answer.</p>
