<p>Welcome to Computer Science Principles! </p>
<p>Here are the rules for Classcraft for you to look over: <a href="../resources/ClasscraftRules.pdf">ClasscraftRules</a></p>
<p>Please complete the following two tasks today: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Fill out the <strong>Tech Survey</strong>. I will use this information to setup your Piazza and Classcraft accounts so do this first.
    <ul>
      <li><a href="https://docs.google.com/a/galileoweb.org/forms/d/1GfvVp93dEogI4H78bTl9BiwfWla_bLFO8XX6OcAhCQ8/viewform">https://docs.google.com/a/galileoweb.org/forms/d/1GfvVp93dEogI4H78bTl9BiwfWla_bLFO8XX6OcAhCQ8/viewform</a></li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Setup your <strong>Google Sites</strong> Portfolio. A Google site is a website. We will be using a Google site to share ideas and to present our apps and other work. For each app that you build you will be asked to create a web page that describes your app and gives visitors links to download and run your app. For non-programming lessons you will be asked to answer questions about a reading or to share your reflections about a contemporary issue such as "Privacy". <br>
    <br>
    By the end of this course you will be very skilled at creating and maintaining your own simple web site. Do your best to make your site attractive and informative. Your site will be one way to express yourself and "Show your stuff!"
