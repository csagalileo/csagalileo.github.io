  title: Pokemon Trainer Test File
  categories: apcsa
---

<p>The GitHub repository has been updated with a new test file for you to test if your <code>Trainer</code> class works. Keep in mind my method names may be different from your method names. Also note that this test file is fairly simple and does not test for every possible situation.</p>

<p>To get the new test file from the updated GitHub repository, you'll need to run the following commands from your terminal:</p>

<p>Add a remote location called "upstream":</p>
<pre><code>
git remote add upstream https://github.com/galileo2015-16/PokemonLabs.git
</code></pre>

<p>Fetch the branches from the upstream repository (for now there is only one branch called upstream/master):</p>
<pre><code>
git fetch upstream
</code></pre>

<p>Make sure you're on the master branch:</p>
<pre><code>
git checkout master
</code></pre>

<p>Merge your master branch with the upstream/master branch:</p>
<pre><code>
git merge upstream/master
</code></pre>
