<p>In the <a href="https://github.com/galileo2015-16/Elevens" target="_blank">Elevens Lab</a>, you will learn more about Object-Oriented Programming and Design in order to create a simple solitaire game called Elevens. This is the most complex lab so far and you will need to use a variety of concepts that you have learned.</p>
<p>It is good practice to stage, commit, and push your changes each day. This lab will take several weeks to complete so you don't want to accidentally lose any work because you didn't push your changes.</p>
