<p>Digital image processing is a subfield of computer science that involves using computer algorithms to manipulate digital images such as photographs or video frames.
In this lab you will be writing methods that modify digital pictures.
In writing these methods you will learn how to traverse a two-dimensional array of integers or objects.
You will also be introduced to nested loops, binary numbers, interfaces, and inheritance.</p>
