<p>Today you will create your first <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/" target="_blank">App Inventor</a> project. Read and follow the directions for the <a href="http://appinventor.mit.edu/explore/ai2/hellopurr.html" target="_blank">HelloPurr</a> app. 
  </p>
<p>After you get your HelloPurr app working, write a reflection in Google Sites portfolio. Create a new page named <strong>Reflection 1</strong> and put the page under Reflections. On your new page, answer the following prompts:</p>
<ul>
  <li>How could we describe &ldquo;event-driven programming&rdquo; to someone who is not familiar with this concept?</li>
  <li>What UI components did you use in your app?</li>
</ul>
