  title: No Texting While Busy Enhancements
  categories: csp
---

<p>Here are some ideas for project enhancements.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Customization:</strong> Add a feature that allows the user to input the message that gets sent automatically while busy. For a simple version of this, a <em>Textbox</em> and a <em>Button</em> could be used.</li>
  <li><strong>Customization:</strong> A more sophisticated version of the above enhancement might be to add a <em>Listpicker</em> that lets the user choose the category of &lsquo;busyness&rsquo; and then sets the outgoing message to one that is appropriate for that category. For example, the categories might by [driving, studying, working] and the corresponding messages might be [&ldquo;Driving, TTYL&rdquo;, &ldquo;Gotta study now sorry&rdquo;, &ldquo;I&rsquo;m at work now and can&rsquo;t respond. I&rsquo;ll get back to you soon..&rdquo;].</li>
  <li><strong>Look and Feel: </strong>Improve the overall appearance of the app by using layouts, images, and other UI features.</li>
  <li><strong>Persistence:</strong> Add a TinyDb component to the app so that their custom replies will persist between uses of the app.</li>
  <li><strong>Settings Screen (Advanced):</strong> Add a second Settings screen that allows the user to set certain Texting and/or app properties. For example, for the Texting component, let the user control whether GoogleVoice is enabled and when the app is receiving messages (Off, Always, Foreground). For the app, maybe the custom message setting could be done on this screen? <br />
    HINT: You may need to use the <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1lnYq4Fuw6DPKohEv1gdqpzNdyugERrw3aI_GPYBh8Y4" target="_blank">How to: Pass Information Between Screens</a> tutorial.</li>
</ul>
<p>Add your app with enhancements to your portfolio.</p>
