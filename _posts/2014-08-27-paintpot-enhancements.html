<p>
Make one or more of the following enhancements to your PaintPot app:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implement a <em>plus button</em> and implement a <em>minus button</em>, which should add/subtract 1 from the dotsize each time it is clicked.</li>
  <li>Add a <em>reset button</em> that, when clicked, sets the dotsize back to its initial value (i.e., 5). (HINT: You'll need a second variable here to remember the initial value of the dotsize.)</li>
  <li><strong>Challenging:</strong> A <em><strong>bug</strong></em> is an error or defect, that prevents the app from working the way it is supposed to. In this app, if the user continues to press <em>ButtonMinus</em>, the value of dotsize will eventually become negative. If dotsize is negative, what will be drawn when the user touches the screen? Try fixing this bug by using an <em><strong>If/Else statement</strong></em>. (Hint: The If/Else block is found under Control in the Blocks Editor Toolbox.)</li>
  <li>Create one or more of your own enhancements for your app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Perform the following steps to add your completed apps to your Google Sites Portfolio:</p>
<ol>
  <li>In App Inventor, package your app by selecting Build and downloading the .apk to your computer.</li>
  <li>Go to Google Drive and upload the .apk file.</li>
  <li>Right click on the file in Google Drive. Change the sharing settings on your .apk file.</li>
  <li>Right click on the file in Google Drive. Click on Show link. Copy the link.</li>
  <li>In Google Sites, on your Creative Projects page, select the Insert menu and choose Link. Paste the link as a Web Addresss. Save the page.</li>
</ol>
