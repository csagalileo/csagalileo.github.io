<p>Lecture notes:
  <a href="PI.pdf" target="_blank">Pokemon & Inheritance</a> | <a href="Visibility and Constructors.pdf" target="_blank">Visibility and Constructors</a>
</p>
<p>You will write a <code>DragonPokemon</code> class that is a subclass of the <code>Pokemon</code> superclass. Here are the things you should include in the <code>DragonPokemon</code> class:</p>
<ul>
  <li>It should be a subclass of the <code>Pokemon</code> superclass.</li>
  <li>It should have instance variables for storing Pokemon <a href="http://bulbapedia.bulbagarden.net/wiki/Dragon_%28type%29" target="_blank">types</a> (note that Pokemon can have up to two types).</li>
  <li>It should have multiple constructors depending on if a type is given when the object is instantiated.</li>
  <li>It should have a method that prints out the Pokemon's types</li>
  <li>Dragon-type Pokemon are powerful so you need to override their <code>attack</code> method to deal 200 damage instead of 50.</li>
  <li>All Dragon-type Pokemon can use an attack called Dragon Rage. Write a new method called <code>dragonRage</code> that allows them to use the superclass's <code>attack</code> method to deal damage eight times (for a total of 400 damage) using Dragon Rage, but does not override/overload the <code>attack</code> method. The hit points of the other Pokemon should be printed out each time it does 50 damage. Use a for loop in this method.</li>
  <li>All variables and methods in this subclass should be set to either <code>public</code> or <code>private</code>.</li>
</ul>
<p>The PokemonLabs repository has been updated with an empty <code>DragonPokemon</code> file and a new test file called <code>DragonTestFile</code> for you to test your subclass with. Fetch the two java files with the same git commands that you used to get the other updated test file.</p>

<p>Once you are finished with both the <code>Trainer</code> class and <code>DragonPokemon</code> class (and you have tested both thoroughly), make sure they are pushed to GitHub and make a pull request on the original repository.</p>
