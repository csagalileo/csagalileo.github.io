<p>Here are some creative projects to enhance the <em>CoinFlip</em> app and help build your programming skills.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Modify the app so that the user can shake the phone to flip the coin. (HINT: Use the <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/reference/components/sensors.html#AccelerometerSensor" target="_blank">Accelerometer Sensor</a>.)</li>
  <li>Modify your app so that &ldquo;heads&rdquo; or &ldquo;tails&rdquo; is spoken when the coin is flipped. (HINT: Use the <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/reference/components/media.html#TextToSpeech" target="_blank">TextToSpeech</a> component.)</li>
  <li>Modify the event handler in the Coin Flip app to use random fraction instead of random integer. (HINT: A <em>random fraction</em> is a decimal number between 0 and 1, not including 1. Some examples: 0, 0.25, 0.33, 0.5, 0.66, 0,75, 0.99.)</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced: </strong>According to <a href="http://mathtourist.blogspot.com/2011/02/penny-bias.html" target="_blank">this report</a>, if you stand a bunch of Lincoln pennies on their edge and then bang the table, they have a strong bias toward coming up heads. Let&rsquo;s suppose the coin has a 70% chance of coming up heads (30% tails) in this experiment. Create a model to simulate this biased coin. (HINT: Create a separate project for this problem.)</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced: </strong>You now have an app that can flip a two-sided coin. Modify your app that so that it can flip a three-sided coin. (Hint: You will need an if/else block with three conditions. You&rsquo;ll need a third image for this problem; here&rsquo;s one that is openly licensed: <a href="http://images.uncyc.org/commons/9/9b/Coin-edge.gif" target="_blank">coin on edge</a>.)</li>
  <li><strong>Be Creative.</strong> Come up with your own ideas to enhance your app.</li>

<p><strong>Complete the reflection on Google Classroom and submit your .apk file.</strong> To get the .apk file from App Inventor, package your app by selecting Build and downloading the .apk to your computer.</p>
