<p>To begin the lesson <a href="http://ai2.appinventor.mit.edu/?repo=templates.appinventor.mit.edu/trincoll/csp/unit3/templates/Magic8BallTemplate/Magic8BallTemplate.asc" target="_blank">open App Inventor with the Magic 8 Ball template</a>. It provides the media you need for this project and a partial version of the User Interface. When the project opens -- be patient, it may take a moment -- use the Save As option to rename it Magic8Ball. </p>

<p>Create an app in App Inventor that models the magic 8 ball toy. Initially, the app should have the image of the 8 ball front, then when the person touches the image, the answer should appear from a list.</p>

<p>The <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_8-Ball" target="_blank">Magic 8 Ball</a> is a fortune telling toy. It is a plastic ball with an 8 on the front. The player thinks of a yes-or-no question and shakes the ball, then turns it over to reveal the answer. Inside the ball is a 20-sided die floating in liquid. The die floats to the top; the back of the toy is a clear window that shows the top side of the die, with one of the responses.</p>

<p>Follow the <a href="https://youtu.be/gtY1qGXBxjw" target="_blank">video tutorial</a> to build an initial version of the Magic 8 Ball App. If you prefer, there is a <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/133cPONCoWoD389iaXbUFXwXRxk7hYZNE40ChXxykm-g" target="_blank">Text Version</a> of the tutorial.</p>

<p>Now that you've finished the tutorial, choose one of the following creative projects to complete:<br>

<ul>
<li>If you recall from the Tutorial video, one problem with the current version of the Shaking block is that it causes the Sound and the Voice to occur at the same time, making it hard to hear the prediction:
<p><img src="https://ram8647.appspot.com/mobileCSP/assets/img/ShakingBlock.png"></p>
<p>One way to fix this is to put a delay between the Play and the Speak actions. The Clock component (Sensor drawer) can be used for this purpose. When the Clock is enabled, it generate a Timer event every so often depending on the value of its TimerInterval milliseconds. The default interval is 1000 milliseconds. Timer events are handled by the Clock.Timer event handler:</p>
<p><img src="https://ram8647.appspot.com/mobileCSP/assets/img/Timer.png"></p>
<p>Using the timer correctly can be tricky. Here are some suggestions:</p>
<ul>
<li>Initially the Timer should be disabled (Clock.enabled property is false). This will prevent it from “ticking” -- i.e., it will prevent its Clock.Timer block from firing.</li>
<li>When you want to delay an action, say Action A, enable the Timer. This will start the Timer “ticking”. The Clock.Timer block will fire on every TimerInterval -- i.e., by default, every second.</li>
<li>When the Clock.Timer block fires, perform Action A and disable the Timer again.</li>
</ul>

<p>Try to use these ideas to put a delay between the playing of the Sound and speaking of the prediction.</p>
</li>
<li>Another shortcoming of the current app is that the Magic 8 Ball provides a prediction whenever it is shaken, even if the user hasn’t asked a question. To fix this, require the user to “speak” their question to the Magic 8-Ball before Magic 8-Ball says its prediction. For this, you’ll need a SpeechRecognizer component (Media drawer). Here’s a <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hSLNx6-mYKY" target="_blank">One Minute Lesson on the SpeechRecognizer</a> that you may find helpful.
