<p>This lesson goes more deeply into the infrastructure and mechanics of the Internet. It explains packet switching, TCP/IP and the protocol hierarchy, as well as IP addresses and domain names.</p>

<strong>Reflection</strong>
<p>Answer the following questions in Google Classroom:</p>
<ol>
  <li><a href="http://tools.pingdom.com/ping/" target="_blank">Pingdom</a> has
free ping and traceroute tools that can be used to observe packet routing, latency time, and
other Internet statistics.  Choose either ping or traceroute with a host name.


<ul>
<li><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ping_(networking_utility)" target="_blank">Ping</a>
 tests whether a host computer is reachable by repeatedly sending data
packets from their server to the host computer.
For each of the following servers, write down the average round trip time (RTT).

<ul>
<li>google.com, yahoo.com, www.sfusd.edu, appinventor.mit.edu
</li></ul>

<p>Here are some questions to answer:

</p><ul>
<li>Did any of the servers lose packets?
</li><li>Are you able to find a server that has a really long RTT or does lose packets?
</li></ul>


</li><li><b>Traceroute</b> lets you trace the route from their server to some destination server. Here are some servers to try.
<ul>
<li>google.com, yahoo.com, www.sfusd.edu, appinventor.mit.edu
</li></ul>

</li><li>Use <a href="http://traceroute.monitis.com/" target="_blank">
the Monitis Traceroute tool</a> to measure
the average latency between various servers on the Internet.  How much
time and how many hops do the following routes take:
<ol>
<li>http://google.com
</li><li>http://whitehouse.gov
</li><li>http://csinquiry.org
</li></ol>

</li></ul>
</li>
<li>Watch <a href="http://youtu.be/b56WwssMxZw" target="_blank">this video</a> that describes how a hacker could view your data on a public network using a packet sniffer.
When and where do you use public networks, how do you use the Internet on them, and how might you protect your data?</li>

<li>Using the tools below, try looking up the <a href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/1696588" target="_blank">IP addresses</a> for various websites, including their subdomains. Do you see any patterns? Now look up your school&#39;s domain name and IP address, and then the IP address for your computer or mobile device. Do you see any patterns?
<ul>
<li><a href="http://www.getip.com/" target="_blank">GetIP.com</a> - find the IP address for a given host name
</li><li><a href="https://www.whatismyip.com/" target="_blank">WhatIsMyIP.com</a> - find the IP address of the device visiting the website
</li><li>Possible searches: 1) google.com, maps.google.com; 2) www.wikipedia.org, en.wikipedia.org; 3) mit.edu, appinventor.mit.edu
