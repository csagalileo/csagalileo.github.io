<p>This week you will work on your final project for our Scratch Unit. You may work alone or with a partner. You must choose to either create a project about your community or create a game in Scratch. See rubrics for requirements and guidelines. You will present your project in front of the class on <strong>Monday, April 6th</strong> (the day we come back from spring break).</p>
