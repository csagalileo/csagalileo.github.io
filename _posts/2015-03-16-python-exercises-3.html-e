<p><em>Functions</em> are an important part of programming that allows us to break complex problems into smaller, more manageable problems through <em>functional decomposition</em>. In fact, functional programming is its own <em>programming paradigm</em>.</p>
<p>Read the &ldquo;<a href="http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/GalileoAOIT/Functions/functions.html" target="_blank">Functions</a>&rdquo; chapter in the Interactive Python textbook. Pay particular attention to the examples with drawing shapes. Also take note of the <em>accumulator pattern</em> mentioned.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Look at the <a href="http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/GalileoAOIT/Labs/lab04_01.html" target="_blank">Drawing a Circle</a> and <a href="http://interactivepython.org/courselib/static/GalileoAOIT/Labs/lab04_01a.html" target="_blank">Lessons from a Triangle</a> lab practice pages. (I will not check these but they will be helpful for the exercise questions.)</li>
  <li>Complete <strong>exercises #1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 13</strong> on the Functions chapter page.</li>
</ul>
<p>In your portfolios, create a new Reflections page called <strong>Python Exercises 3</strong>, and write your answers for exercises <strong>#1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, and 13</strong>.</p>
