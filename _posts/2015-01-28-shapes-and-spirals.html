<p>We will be drawing shapes and spirals using the pen blocks and variables. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Create scripts to draw the following shapes in Scratch using the pen blocks and repeat blocks:
    <ul>
      <li>  Square (when &quot;4&quot; key pressed)</li>
      <li>Equilateral Triangle (when &quot;3&quot; key pressed)</li>
      <li>Pentagon (when &quot;5&quot; key pressed)</li>
      <li>Hexagon (when &quot;6&quot; key pressed)</li>
      <li>Octagon (when &quot;8&quot; key pressed)</li>
      <li>Circle (when &quot;c&quot; key pressed)</li>
      <li>Five-pointed Star (when &quot;s&quot; key pressed)</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>You will also create a script that will draw a variable-sided and variable-sized shape. You will need two variables for this: sides and size. Follow the format used for your other shape scripts but use the variables in place of the actual numbers. This scirpt should start when the &quot;v&quot; key is pressed.</li>
  <li>Lastly, you will modify the variable shapes script to draw spirals. This will  require changing the size variable after each iteration in your loop. This script should start when the green flag is clicked.</li>
</ol>
