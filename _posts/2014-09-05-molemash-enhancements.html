  title: MoleMash Enhancements

<p>Make enhancements to your MoleMash app:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personalize the game by adding your own image for both the background and the "mole".</li>
  <li>You could also implement keeping track of the number of misses -- i.e., the number of times the player failed to touch the Mole -- and factor this into the score.</li>
  <li><strong>Challenging:</strong> Change the speed of the mole when the player reaches a certain score. (Hint: Recall that in this app, the Mole does not control its speed. Suggestion: This feature will require you to use an if-block which can be found in the Toolbox&rsquo;s Control drawer.</li>
  <li><strong>Advanced:</strong> Try adding in a winning score feature that congratulates the user when they reach a certain score. (Hint: Add a TextToSpeech component and have it say something when the player reaches a certain score. This feature will require you to use an if-block which can be found in the Toolbox&rsquo;s Control drawer.)</li>
  <li>Create one or more of your own enhancements or variations for this app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Reflection: Create a page for <strong>Reflection 7</strong> and respond to the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Give brief descriptions of the enhancements you added to your app. Provide screen shots of important blocks and describe how you used them to solve certain programming problems.</li>
  <li>When the user touches an ImageSprite, both the Canvas.Touched and ImageSprite.Touched events are triggered. This is important for more complex games. For instance, suppose there are two "moles" in your game. If you hit one, you earn a point. If you hit the other, you lose two points. If you hit the Canvas and don't hit any mole, you lose 1 point. How would you code this?</li>
  <li>How do you speed up the movement of the mole? What is the fastest it could move?</li>
</ul>
