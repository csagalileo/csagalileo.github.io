<p>Read this <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_data" target="blank">Wikipedia Article on Big Data</a>, then explore some of the examples of big data that are included in the article. Try to find at least 2 data sets that interest you. Answer the portfolio reflection questions about the data set.</p>
<ul>
  <li>Student Debt Data (Here's a nice visualization of <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2012/05/13/business/student-debt-at-colleges-and-universities.html?ref=tuition&amp;_r=2&amp;" target="blank">student debt</a> that was put together by the New York Times.)</li>
  <li>Growth of the Internet (This is a nice <a href="http://evolutionofweb.appspot.com/#/growth/day" target="_blank">interactive visualization</a> of how the Internet has grown and when various technologies have been introduced.)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Reflection</strong></p>
<p>Create a page named <em>Reflection 32</em> under the <em>Reflections</em> category of your portfolio and answer the following questions. </p>
<ol>
  <li>Choose one of the data sets listed above and give a brief description of it. What specifically were the types of data (text, sounds, transactions, etc.) included in the data set you chose?</li>
  <li>What new facts did you learn when exploring the data set? List at least 3 facts.</li>
  <li>Write a question you have about the data set you chose. Now, convert that question into a hypothesis (a statement) with your prediction about the data.<br />
    (Hypotheses take the form of &quot;If __________, then _________.&quot; For example, a hypothesis about the student debt data could be, &quot;If the tuition costs are higher at an institution, the student debt will be higher.&quot;</li>
  <li>Identify at least one security and/or privacy concern that is associated with the data in the data set you chose?</li>
  <li>If your data set included a visualization, what was useful about the visualization? How would you change or improve the visualization?</li>
</ol>
