<p>Write your responses to the <strong>bolded</strong> questions in your journal.</p>
<p><strong>Part 1</strong></p>
<p>A program passes <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Test" target="_blank">The Turing Test</a> (en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_Test) if a person can have a conversation with both it and a person and not be able to tell which one is the computer.</p>
<p>You will be talking with some chatterbots. Here are some sample questions you can ask the chatterbots.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Are you a computer?</li>
  <li>What is the next number in the sequence 3, 6, 9, 12, 15?</li>
  <li>What do you think of nuclear weapons?</li>
  <li>What is 2 x 78?</li>
  <li>What is the square root of two?</li>
  <li>Add 34957 to 70764.</li>
  <li>Do you like school?</li>
  <li>Do you like dancing?</li>
  <li>What day is it today?</li>
  <li>What time is it?</li>
  <li>How many days are there in February in a leap year?</li>
  <li>How many days are there in a week?</li>
  <li>For which country is the flag a red circle on a white background?</li>
  <li>Do you like to read books?</li>
  <li>What food do you like to eat?</li>
</ol>
<p>Try each of these chatterbots and ask it a few of these questions. Talk to each machine until it says something that no human, not even a human pretending to be a machine, would be likely to say. <strong>Explain why no person would ever give this response. What might the machine have been doing to produce that response?</strong></p>
<ul>
  <li>Eliza (<a href="http://www-ai.ijs.si/eliza/eliza.html" target="_blank">http://www-ai.ijs.si/eliza/eliza.html</a>)</li>
  <li>Santa (<a href="http://www.alicebot.org/Santa/" target="_blank">http://www.alicebot.org/Santa/</a>)</li>
  <li>Elbot (<a href="http://www.elbot.com/" target="_blank">http://www.elbot.com/</a>)</li>
  <li>Bearbot (<a href="http://www.square-bear.co.uk/games/bearbot/chat.htm" target="_blank">http://www.square-bear.co.uk/games/bearbot/chat.htm</a>)</li>
  <li>Mitsuku (<a href="http://www.square-bear.co.uk/mitsuku/chat.htm" target="_blank">http://www.square-bear.co.uk/mitsuku/chat.htm</a>)</li>
  <li>Cleverbot (<a href="http://www.cleverbot.com/" target="_blank">http://www.cleverbot.com/</a>)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Try to come up with one diagnostic question that could help you to differentiate human and machines.</strong> Ask this question to all 6 of these bots. <strong>How well did they do? Does the machine always respond the same way when asked the same thing?</strong></p>
<p>In your journal, also answer the following questions:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>How realistic are each of the chatterbots? Which ones would pass the Turing Test?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Which of the chatterbots was the most like a real person? Why/how?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Which questions did you ask to help you diagnose whether or not the chatterbot is a computer or not? Which questions were most effective?</strong></li>
  <li><strong>Can these machines think? Why or why not? If this machine passes the Turing test, what can we conclude about its intelligence?</strong></li>
</ul>
