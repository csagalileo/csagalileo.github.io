<p>In many ways algorithms are at the heart of computer science. After all, algorithms, expressed in computer code and interpreted by the computer, are what make our computers such powerful and adaptable machines.</p>
<p>An <em>algorithm</em> is <u>step-by-step procedure</u> of <u>precise instructions</u> that performs some calculation or computation.</p>
<p>Algorithms are constructed out of basic building blocks called <em>control structures</em>. There are three basic control structures:</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong><em>Sequence</em></strong>– a sequence of instructions or statements.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Selection</em></strong>– a conditional instruction that lets the program branch between two or more alternatives.</li>
  <li><strong><em>Repetition</em></strong>– a structure that repeats one or more instructions.</li>
</ul>
<p>What's amazing is that any problem that can be solved by means of an algorithm can be constructed by using just these three control structures. So, after this unit you will have learned all that you need to design and build any algorithm that you can think of.</p>

<p>Create a new portfolio page named <strong>Reflection 16</strong> under the <em>Reflections</em> category of your portfolio and answer the following questions:</p>
<ol>
  <li>What is an algorithm? </li>
  <li>What are the three types of control structures found in algorithms? Provide an example of each type of control structure.</li>
  <li>In this lesson you learned about pseudocode. Try writing some pseudocode for how to wash the dishes.</li>
</ol>
