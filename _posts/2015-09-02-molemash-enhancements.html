<p>Make at least three of the following enhancements to your MoleMash app:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Personalize the game by adding your own image for both the background and the "mole".</li>
  <li>Implement keeping track of the number of misses -- i.e., the number of times the player failed to touch the Mole -- and factor this into the score.</li>
  <li>Change the speed of the mole when the player reaches a certain score. (Hint: Recall that in this app, the Mole does not control its speed. Suggestion: This feature will require you to use an if-block which can be found in the Toolbox&rsquo;s Control drawer.</li>
  <li>Try adding in a winning score feature that congratulates the user when they reach a certain score. (Hint: Add a TextToSpeech component and have it say something when the player reaches a certain score. This feature will require you to use an if-block which can be found in the Toolbox&rsquo;s Control drawer.)</li>
</ul>
<p>Complete the reflection on Google Classroom and submit your .apk file. To get the .apk file from App Inventor, package your app by selecting Build and downloading the .apk to your computer.</p>
