<p>Lecture notes: <a href="2-Darrays_2014APCSA.pdf" target="_blank">2-D Arrays</a>.
  <br>(Knowledge of 2-D arrays is not optional; you will use them in the next lab regardless of whether or not you do Mazeman.)
</p>
<p>There are two extra credit assignments that you may do. These assignments are optional, but if you wish to do them, they are to be completed over Thanksgiving break. Any extra credit assignments turned in after November 30th will not be graded.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mazeman</strong> [15 points]: Modify the 2-D array in MazeManApplet.java to create a different/better maze for MazeMan. Include a screenshot of your maze in your pull request. Mazeman repo is available here: <a href="https://github.com/galileo2015-16/MazeMan" target="_blank">https://github.com/galileo2015-16/MazeMan</a></li>
  <li><strong>APCSA Vocab</strong> [50 points]: In this assignment, you will create a quiz program for all the vocabulary you are learning in this class. You must include all terms/definitions from the glossaries in the <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/thinkapjava.pdf" target="_blank">Think Java</a> textbook. You may want to reuse parts of the Magpie Lab for this assignment. See the GitHub repo for requirements for how your quiz program should behave: <a href="https://github.com/galileo2015-16/APCSA-Vocab" target="_blank">https://github.com/galileo2015-16/APCSA-Vocab</a>.
  </li>
</ul>
