<p>Lecture notes: <a href="2-Darrays_2014APCSA.pdf" target="_blank">2-D Arrays</a>. 
  <br>(Knowledge of 2-D arrays is not optional; you will use them in the next lab regardless of whether or not you do Mazeman.)
</p>
<p>There are two extra credit assignments that you may do. These assignments are optional, but if you wish to do them, they are to be completed over Thanksgiving break. Any extra credit assignments turned in after November 30th will not be graded.</p>
<ul>
  <li><strong>Mazeman</strong> [15 points]: Modify the 2-D array in MazeManApplet.java to create a different/better maze for MazeMan. Include a screenshot of your maze in your pull request. Mazeman repo is available here: <a href="https://github.com/galileo2015-16/MazeMan" target="_blank">https://github.com/galileo2015-16/MazeMan</a></li>
  <li><strong>APCSA Vocab</strong> [50 points]: In this assignment, you will create a quiz program for all the vocabulary you are learning in this class. You must include all terms/definitions from the glossaries in the <a href="http://www.greenteapress.com/thinkapjava/thinkapjava.pdf" target="_blank">Think Java</a> textbook. You may want to reuse parts of the Magpie Lab for this assignment. Your quiz program should behave in the following way:
  <ul>
    <li>Your program will print a welcome message (e.g. "APCSA Vocabulary Program") at the start when you run it.</li>
    <li>Your program will store all the terms and definitions from the glossaries listed above (using an array or other method).</li>
    <li>It will select and print a random definition and ask for the corresponding term.</li>
    <li>The user will input a corresponding term via the console.</li>
    <li>Your program will determine whether the user's term matches the definition.</li>
    <li>If the user's input is correct, the program will print a message saying that it is correct and select a new random definition to print.</li>
    <li>If the user's input is incorrect, the program will print a message saying that it is incorrect and reprint the same definition.</li>
    <li>If the user's input is "skip", the program will select a new random definition to print.</li>
    <li>The program continues selecting random definitions and asking the user to input the corresponding term until the user inputs the message "quit", in which case the program will print "Bye" and then terminate.</li>
  </ul>
  </li>
</ul>
