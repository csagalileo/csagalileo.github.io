<p>The following script is intended to keep track of the names of the players of a game, but it has a bug! <strong>Find and fix the bug.</strong> Once you are done with it, you may find it useful in your other projects!</p>

<p>After you fix that problem, we want to make the sprite <strong>read all of the names from our players list</strong>. This is a very common type of problem when dealing with lists: we want to do the same thing for each item in the list. To tackle this problem, we are going to use a variable called index to keep track of the position of the element in the list we are processing.</p>

<p>Once you get the script above to work, try to make a script that will <strong>say all of the player names together</strong>, with the appropriate commas, spaces, and the word &ldquo;and&rdquo;, as shown below.</p>
