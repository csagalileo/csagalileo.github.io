<p>
Make the following enhancements to your PaintPot app:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Implement a <em>plus button</em> and implement a <em>minus button</em>, which should add/subtract 1 from the dotsize each time it is clicked. (For a hint on how to increment variables, watch this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/Odw-potCwrM" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/Odw-potCwrM</a>)</li>
  <li>Add a <em>reset button</em> that, when clicked, sets the dotsize back to its initial value (i.e., 5). (HINT: You'll need a second variable here to remember the initial value of the dotsize.)</li>
  <li>A <em><strong>bug</strong></em> is an error or defect, that prevents the app from working the way it is supposed to. In this app, if the user continues to press <em>ButtonMinus</em>, the value of dotsize will eventually become negative. If dotsize is negative, what will be drawn when the user touches the screen? Try fixing this bug by using an <em><strong>If/Else statement</strong></em>. For how to conditionally set a variable, watch this video: <a href="https://youtu.be/VrzzXpJW8co" target="_blank">https://youtu.be/VrzzXpJW8co</a> (Hint: The If/Else block is found under Control in the Blocks Editor Toolbox.)</li>
  <li>Create one or more of your own enhancements for your app.</li>
</ul>

  Complete the reflection on Google Classroom and submit your .apk file. To get the .apk file from App Inventor, package your app by selecting Build and downloading the .apk to your computer.</p>
