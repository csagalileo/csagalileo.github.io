<p>Use <a href="http://logic.ly/demo/" target="_blank">Logicly</a> to play with different logic gates. Try and build logic gates using combinations of other logic gates!</p>

<p>In your portfolio, create a new page named <strong>Reflection 5</strong> and provide thoughtful answers to the following questions: </p>
<ul>
  <li>Give an example of a <em>high-level hardware abstraction</em> and describe what it does. </li>
  <li>Give an example of a <em>low-level hardware abstraction</em> and describe what it does. </li>
  <li>Describe how an <em>AND gate</em>, the <em>Boolean AND function</em>, and the<em> symbol for the AND gate</em> are related to each other. Which is more specific? Which is more general or abstract? </li>
</ul>
