<p>We will learn about variables in this project and use them to create a simple food game as demonstrated in class. Add your own creative touch to it by choosing your own sprites and a relevant backdrop. Enhance the food game by adding a food that is worth 2 points when clicked on (healthy) and adding a food that is -3 points when clicked on (unhealthy). Add your project to the <a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/studios/880130/" target="_blank">Food Game studio</a>.</p>
