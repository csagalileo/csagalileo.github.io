<p>You will complete the Matryoshka lab today. See the GitHub repository at <a href="https://github.com/galileo2015-16/Matryoshka" target="_blank">https://github.com/galileo2015-16/Matryoshka</a></p>
<p>The lab has two parts. Part 1 will be creating the Matryoshka objects and writing recursive methods to determine various properties about the collection of Matryoshka dolls. Part 2 will be more practice with ArrayLists and writing the same method recursively and iteratively.</p>
<p>Remember to push your changes to GitHub when you are done and make a pull request to submit the lab.</p>
