Exploring Computer Science is designed to introduce students to the breadth of the field of computer science through an exploration of engaging and accessible topics. The course is designed to focus on the conceptual ideas of computing and help students understand why certain tools or languages might be utilized to solve particular problems. The goal of Exploring Computer Science is to develop in students the computational practices of algorithm development, problem solving and programming within the context of problems that are relevant to the lives of todayâ€™s students. Students will also be introduced to topics such as interface design, limits of computers, and societal and ethical issues. 
</p>
<p>
The six major units in the course are: 
<ul>
<li>Human Computer Interaction </li>
<li>Problem Solving </li>
<li>Web Design </li>
<li>Intro to Programming </li>
<li>Computing and Data Analysis </li>
<li>Robotics/Electronics </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
Throughout the course students will gain experience in employing the following computational practices: 
<ul>
<li>Analyze the effects of developments in computing </li>
<li>Design and implement creative solutions and artifacts </li>
<li>Apply abstractions and models </li>
<li>Analyze their computational work and the work of others </li>
<li>Communicate computational thought processes, procedures, and results to others </li>
<li>Collaborate with peers on computing activities </li>
</ul>
</p>
<p>
This course is a recommended prerequisite for Computer Programming, which explores computation and programming in detail, as well as Computer Science: Principles, a new computer science course focused on the big ideas of computing. Students who find they enjoy abstract and creative thinking should plan to continue in this sequence.
